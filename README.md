# Excape
First Person Exploration Game made in Unreal Engine 3

Story and Theme:
The main story of the game is that a character has been put in an enclosure to roam.
The main character must escape the enclosure by exploring the infrastructure and taking advantage of objects that can lead to escape.
For the setting it would be something like an alien planet, something like a human captured.
For the main character or other NPCs would likely be generic models. Unnamed main character and aliens run the enclosure.
