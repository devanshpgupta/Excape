# Excape
First Person Exploration Game made in Unreal Engine 3

Story and Theme:
The main story of the game is that a character has been put in an enclosure to roam.
The main character must escape the enclosure by exploring the infrastructure and taking advantage of objects that can lead to escape.
For the setting it would be something like an alien planet, something like a human captured.
For the main character or other NPCs would likely be generic models. Unnamed main character and aliens run the enclosure.

How to play the game:
Step 1: Install Unreal Engine 3
Step 2: Open the Demo Level
Step 3: Hit the Play Button and Enjoy !!

GamePlay:
Start with Demo Level. It will toggle you to the Main Menu.
Start Menu:
It has 4 Options:

3.Help: Story and Theme
4. Quit

After clicking on Start Game from Main Menu you will enter the First Level.
First Level:
You will be enclosed in a room and the Door is locked, so the player will have to look for an alternate way to get out of the room.
Once the player is out of the room, he will have to stay away from the Guards i.e. Knarrs
(Knarrs are the Guards on the alien Planet. They have great visibility. If they see you then you will follow you. You will have to escape from them since if they catch you, they will put you back in the same enclosed room in level 1 always).

You can take the help of other aliens such as Blob to escape the level. Blob will provide you different types of abilities in each level that can help you exit. But inorder to take help from Blob you will have to free them. They will be in a prision and to free them you will have to search for a Blue key card that can help you free the Blob. 
Once you have freed the Blob you can use the abilitie by Pressing 'L' key twice. After that you will be able to escape the level by bluffing the Knarrs.
  
 Second Level:
 You will be now one step closer to exiting the planet. You will have to perform the same tasks as in Level 1 but this time Knarrs will be more smart. You can find how different they are by playing the game.
 
 Last Level:
  In this level you will have to create a route to exit gate avoiding all the knarrs that will set you free.
